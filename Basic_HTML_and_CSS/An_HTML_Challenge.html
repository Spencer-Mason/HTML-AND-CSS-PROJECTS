            <h2>Article One</h2>
            <p>This is a file showing the use of the &lt;article&gt; tag in HTML.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h2>Article Two</h2>
            <p>This is the second article in the file. Here I will also demonstrate the use of the &lt;details&gt; tag.</p>
            <details>
                <summary>Click Here</summary>
                <p>The &lt;details&gt; tag is used to make an interactive widget that the user can open and close on command. It is used in conjunction with the &lt;summary&gt; tag.</p>
            </details>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h2>Article Three</h2>
            <p>Here is the third article. It's <time datetime="2024-11-04 18:30">Monday</time> at <time>6:30</time>, and I am demonstrating the use of the &lt;time&gt; tag and datetime attribute. They don't change the appearance of anything.</p>
