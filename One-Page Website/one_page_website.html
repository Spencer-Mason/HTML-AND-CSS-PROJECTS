                <p>Cthulhu is a fictional cosmic entity created by H. P. Lovecraft for his short story "The Call of Cthulhu". First appearing in the February 1928 issue of the pulp magazine Weird Tales, he is depicted as an octopoid Great Old One of enormous power who lies in a death-like slumber in his sunken city of R'lyeh beneath the Pacific Ocean. He is the namesake and the best-known element of the Cthulhu Mythos, appearing in the works of numerous authors following Lovecraft and frequently referenced in popular culture.</p>

Chambers short stories "The Yellow Sign" and "The Repairer of Reputations", which appeared in his short story collection The King in Yellow.</p>
